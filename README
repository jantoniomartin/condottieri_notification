`condottieri_notification` is a Django application that implements a new backend for `pinax-notifications`.

This application stores notices in the database, using a `Notice` model, so that the user can see a list of notices. This model has been taken from the old `django-notification`.

Usage
-----

First, add `condottieri_notification` to `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`.

Then, add the following item to `settings.PINAX_NOTIFICATIONS_BACKENDS`:

`('on site', 'condottieri_notification.backends.SiteBackend')`

And last, include `condottieri_notification.urls` in your urls.
